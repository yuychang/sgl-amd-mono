"""The Kimi-K3.1 forward that kimi_k31 reproduces for a routed step, pinned by
source digest on the SGLang Kimi-K3.1 is served with (dev_amd, e67b2062e2).

``wide.Wide.backbone`` reproduces the backbone, and ``Wide._tail_front`` a DSA
layer's forward up to its MoE's TP partials; the outer forwards are Kimi-K3's
``_Built``, pinned in test_kimi_k3_forward_drift.py. The layer forward's MegaMoE and CP-shard MLP branches and the causal-LM
forward's CP branch are not taken by a routed verify step (no MoE a2a backend, CP
only on context-parallel extends).
